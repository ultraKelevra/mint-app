				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<h3>What's a KID?</h3>
				<p>
					Every <span class="important">Hoodie Kid</span> is a unique
					<span class="important">ERC-721</span> token in the
					<span class="important">Etherium blockchain</span
					>.<br />Each token is connected to a programmatically
					generated profile picture, hosted on IPFS. This pictures are
					made from over <span class="epic">120 traits</span> like
					expressions, hats, clothings, hairstyles, and more. Some of
					this traits are more <span class="epic">rare</span> than
					others. But all traits are cool.
				</p>
				<h3>What do I get?</h3>
				<p>
					Additionally to a super dope profile picture...<br />
					Several
					<span class="gold">perks</span> we will be given to kid
					holders during this year (See
					<a href="#starmap">STARMAP</a> section) And additional perks
					will come to the holders as our future plans develop and our
					STARMAP grows. Additionally, the projects and events will be
					discussed in a
					<span class="important">patreons-only chats</span> in our
					Discord Server. Kids holders will gain access to this chat.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Do I get more <span class="gold">PERKS</span> having
					<span class="epic">RARER Hoodie Kidz</span>?
				</h3>
				<p>
					In next events we will reveal
					<span class="gold">perks</span> and
					<span class="gold">merch</span> that might be
					<span class="important">connected to the kid you hold</span
					>. So... in that case, a
					<span class="epic">rare kid</span> will most likely mean
					<span class="epic">rarer perks and merch</span>. But notice
					that the vast mayority of
					<span class="gold">perks</span> will be available to all
					<span class="gold">patreons</span>. All
					<span class="gold">kid holders</span> are equally important
					for us. Each kid will be used for airdrop, reward, raffle or
					mint all <span class="gold">perks</span> we will drop in the
					future
					<span class="important">
						independent of the kid's
						<span class="epic">rarity</span> </span
					>. <br /><br />
					<span class="orange"
						>There will be no "substantial" rewards coming from
						<span class="important">The Team</span> to holders of
						<span class="epic">"rarer"</span> kidz</span
					><br />
